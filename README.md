# TradeItIosTicketSDK

NOTE: To build select the framework target, and iOS Device and build (it will build for both iOS and Simulators)

Also, the frameworks are copied to this location:  ${HOME}/Code/TradeIt/TradeItIosTicketSDKLib/  if that's not where your code is, your missing out on life :) you can go into the Framework Build Phases and modify the last couple lines in the MultiPlatform Build Script
